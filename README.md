1. Navigate to the Broadcast URL
Open the broadcast you want to download (e.g., https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1LyxBgZQMZnKN).

2. Open Developer Tools
Use the shortcut âŒ¥âŒ˜I to open Developer Tools.

3. Reload the Page
Go to the 'Network' tab and reload the page using âŒ˜R.

4. Search for the Playlist File
In the 'Network' tab, look for the magnifying glass icon ðŸ”Ž or press âŒ˜F to open the search bar. Search for .m3u8 files and locate one that starts with playlist_ (e.g., playlist_16720814837819922326.m3u8).

5. Copy the Playlist URL
Click on the playlist_ file to view its details. Under the 'Headers' tab, copy the Request URL. This URL contains the list of 3-second segments (chunks) that make up the broadcast. If you paste this URL into your browser, the file will download automatically.

6. Find the Base URL for Chunks
Search again for .m3u8 files and select any that start with chunk. Under the 'Headers' tab, copy the Request URL (e.g., https://prod-fastly-us-west-2.video.pscp.tv/Transcoding/v1/hls/NRFBd69zTUCBivcilN6PToDQHPJDEeypdd3LmsDLdfi5_CNiDRoXvtMnnj7K0zyZENPgk-kASUfa1fndQMqRkw/transcode/us-west-2/periscope-replay-direct-prod-us-west-2-public/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsInZlcnNpb24iOiIyIn0.eyJFbmNvZGVyU2V0dGluZyI6ImVuY29kZXJfc2V0dGluZ18xMDgwcDMwXzEwIiwiSGVpZ2h0IjoxMDgwLCJLYnBzIjo1NTAwLCJXaWR0aCI6MTkyMH0.OImMZabKYJ0cs9CnIapU-4aBk6KNBiJxi1hh-6l4BZ4/chunk_1725924787374910918_1437_a.ts).

7. Modify the URL for All Chunks
The URL will end with the name of the chunk you selected at the end, delete it and insert the base url in the main.py file under the base_url variable. 
This base URL can be used to download any chunk by replacing the chunk name at the end of the URL.

**What the Program Does**
This script automates the process of downloading the broadcast chunks and concatenating them into a single MP4 file:

It reads each line from the playlist file, which contains the names of the broadcast chunks.
Using the base URL, it downloads all the chunks sequentially.
Finally, it concatenates all the downloaded chunks into a single MP4 file, recreating the full broadcast.
